    "Imagery Description": "(a) Draped woman to left with 'skewer of fruit' and wreath, (b) nude youth with white fillet and thyrsus. From the same tomb comes a lid in two elements, each consisting of a lekanis decorated with (i) (a) female to left, (b) bird to right; (ii) female heads (a) to left, (b) to right. These are at present given the inventory numbers 26630 and 26637, but they fit together and are part of the same vase. The number 26630 belongs to a much larger lebes gamikos with a more elaborate lid, and it looks as if there had been some confusion, especially as 26630 seems to be missing.",
