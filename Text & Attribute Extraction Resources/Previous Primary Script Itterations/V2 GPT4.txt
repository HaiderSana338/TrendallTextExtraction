I'm working on a project that requires me to extract data from a pdf file and format these entries into an excel spreadsheet to later be fed into a database for quick and easy access, I have a brief overview of the pattern that can be observed in these entries, and is as follows.

This is a brief I created earlier, here is a pattern we can use to filter out each piece of information into its relevant attribute. For a single given input let's assume that all text until ", from" correlates to the inventory ID, with any text after ", from" being the Provenience. If this text is not found by the time we find the text "Ht" let's assume the provenience is not described. "Ht" and the numbers after it should be interpreted as the height dimension, the words "diam" may also follow which indicate the diameter. To find the bibliographic reference we should assume that this is the text following the last dimension measurement (be it only Ht. or, Ht. and diam.), UNTIL we find the imagery description, which can for the time being assumed to start at the text [a], [a), (a], or (a). This is as a result of OCR issues. For the time being we won't worry about the additional notes section, this can be filtered out at a later time manually. For now we're focusing on just making this work for one sample entry, but we will eventually scale it up at a later date. We don't need to worry about the artefact type in this situation as we can assume all artefacts are the same type.

This is copy-pasted from another GPT chat instance I had where I initially tried to create a regex python solution, however due to the complexity and poor quality of the PDF OCR scan, I want to use your own logical processing functionality to format these data entries as is required. With the following data points for each column being as follows:

Artefact Type, Inventory ID, Provenience, Dimensions, Bibliographic References, Imagery Description

Here is a list of items to start with, remember to format them into a table
