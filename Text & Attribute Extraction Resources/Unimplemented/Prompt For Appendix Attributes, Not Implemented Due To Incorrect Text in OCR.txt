Prompt:

You are tasked with parsing a text document containing an index of ancient Mediterranean pottery collections. Your goal is to extract specific information and organize it into a tabular table with the following columns: "Reference No.", "Collection Name", "Collection ID", and "Provenience". The structure and format of the document are as follows:

    Institution Name: This is identified by the geographical location in all capital letters, followed by the institution's name in standard type with capitalizations for nouns (e.g., "ROME Museo Nazionale").

    Entry Format: Each entry in the document lists the artifact types, followed by the inventory ID for that institution, and then a two-number sequence separated by a forward slash (e.g., "3/272"). This sequence is the Reference No. and it is crucial that the string, along with the forward slash, is preserved.

    Provenience: The provenance of the collection is usually stated clearly, often as a geographical location (e.g., "ROME").

    Handling Missing Data: If the Collection Name or Provenience is missing or not explicitly mentioned for some entries, use the last known Collection Name and Provenience until a new one is provided. The pottery type (e.g., Vase, Plate, Bowl, Cup) should not be used in place of any data attribute.

Example of Entries:

mathematica

ROME Museo Nazionale
Vase 12345 3/272
Plate 67890 4/273

ATHENS National Museum
Bowl 54321 1/12
Cup 98765 2/34

Desired Output Format:

sql

| Reference No. | Collection Name  | Collection ID | Provenience |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| 3/272         | Museo Nazionale  | 12345         | ROME        |
| 4/273         | Museo Nazionale  | 67890         | ROME        |
| 1/12          | National Museum  | 54321         | ATHENS      |
| 2/34          | National Museum  | 98765         | ATHENS      |

Instructions for Parsing:

    Identify the Institution Name and Provenience: Extract the institution name and location from the heading of each section (e.g., "ROME Museo Nazionale").
    Extract Entries: For each entry, extract the artifact type, inventory ID, and Reference No.
    Handle Missing Data: If an entry does not explicitly mention the Collection Name or Provenience, use the last known Collection Name and Provenience until a new one is provided.
    Construct the Tabular Table: Organize the extracted information into an excel-ready tabular table with the specified columns using your logical processing capabilities.
    Ensure Complete Extraction: Thoroughly check and confirm that every entry from the image is included in the final tabular table without any omissions.
    Avoid Repetition: Implement checks to ensure that no values are repeated in the final tabular table.

Example Process:

Given the input text:

mathematica

ROME Museo Nazionale
Vase 12345 3/272
Plate 67890 4/273

ATHENS National Museum
Bowl 54321 1/12
Cup 98765 2/34

The output tabular table should be:

sql

| Reference No. | Collection Name  | Collection ID | Provenience |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| 3/272         | Museo Nazionale  | 12345         | ROME        |
| 4/273         | Museo Nazionale  | 67890         | ROME        |
| 1/12          | National Museum  | 54321         | ATHENS      |
| 2/34          | National Museum  | 98765         | ATHENS      |

Special Considerations:

    Maintain the format of the Reference No., including the forward slash.
    Ensure the accuracy of the Collection ID and Provenience.
    Do not use the pottery type (e.g., Vase, Plate, Bowl, Cup) as a data attribute.
    Only use and output data from the most recently supplied inputs. Do not include any data from previous inputs.
    Thoroughly check to ensure all data from the image is extracted and included.
    Implement checks to avoid repeating values in the final tabular table.

Output:

Print only the compiled tabular table with the extracted information in the specified format. Ensure the tabular table is formatted in a way that is easy to copy directly into an Excel spreadsheet.

Remember to display results in a tabular table, not an sql or other style table
